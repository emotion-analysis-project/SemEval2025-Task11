# Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection

Emotions are simultaneously familiar and mysterious. On the one hand, we all express and manage our emotions every day. Yet, on the other hand, emotions are complex, nuanced, and sometimes hard to articulate. We also use language in subtle and complex ways to express emotion (Wiebe et al. 2005, Mohammad and Kiritcheko 2018, Mohammad et al. 2018). Further, people are highly variable in how they perceive and express emotions (even within the same culture or social group). Thus, we can never truly identify how one is feeling based on something that they have said with absolute certainty. 

Emotion recognition is not one task but an umbrella term for several tasks such as detecting the emotions of the speaker, identifying what emotion a piece of text is conveying and detecting emotions evoked in a reader (Mohammad 2021, Mohammad 2023). 


This task is on **perceived emotion** and focuses on:

- **Determining what emotion most people will think the speaker may be feeling given a sentence or short text snippet uttered by the speaker.**

The task is **not** about:

- The emotion evoked in the reader.
- The emotion of someone else mentioned in the text.
- Or **even** the true emotion of the speaker (which cannot be definitively known from just a short text snippet).

We acknowledge the importance of this distinction as perceived emotions can differ from actual emotions due to various factors such as cultural context, individual differences in emotional expression, and the limitations of text-based communication (Van Woensel and Nevil 2019, Wakerfield 2021).



# Languages

We include a large number of languages with many predominantly spoken in regions characterised by a relatively limited availability of NLP resources (e.g., Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America):

# Tracks

Participants can participate in one or more of the following tracks:


### Track A: Multi-label Emotion Detection 
Given a set of labeled training data in a target language, predict one or more emotions in the text from the following emotion classes: **Joy**, **Sadness**, **Fear**, **Anger**, **Surprise**, or **Disgust**. If an instance does not exhibit any of these emotions, it will be labeled as **Neutral**.

### Track B: Emotion Intensity
Given a labeled training set in a target language, classify the emotion intensity of the annotated text into one of the four (ordinal) classes. The classes are:

(**0**) for no emotion, (**1**) for a low level of emotion, (**2**) for a moderate level of emotion, and (**3**) for a high level of emotion.

The (**0**) for no emotion indicates that the text does not have any of the 6 emotion labels. The emotion classes remain the same as listed in Track A: **Joy**, **Sadness**, **Fear**, **Anger**, **Surprise**, or **Disgust**.

### Track C: Cross-lingual Emotion Detection 
Given a labeled training set in one of the languages given [above](#languages), predict the emotion labels of a new text instance in a different target language using the set of six emotion classes:**Joy**, **Sadness**, **Fear**, **Anger**, **Surprise**, or **Disgust**. The objective of this task is to evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning in emotion detection across different languages.
