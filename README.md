# Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection

Emotions are simultaneously familiar and mysterious. On the one hand, we all express and manage our emotions every day. Yet, on the other hand, emotions are complex, nuanced, and sometimes hard to articulate. 

We use language in subtle and complex ways to express emotion (Wiebe et al. 2005, Mohammad and Kiritcheko 2018, Mohammad et al. 2018). Further, people are highly variable in how they perceive and express emotions (even within the same culture or social group). Thus, we can never truly identify how one is feeling based on something that they have said with absolute certainty. 

Emotion recognition is not one task but an umbrella term for several tasks such as detecting the emotions of the speaker, identifying what emotion a piece of text is conveying and detecting emotions evoked in a reader (Mohammad 2021, Mohammad 2023). 


This task is on **perceived emotions** and focuses on:

- **Determining what emotion most people will think the speaker may be feeling given a sentence or a short text snippet uttered by the speaker.**

The task is **not** about:

- The emotion evoked in the reader.
- The emotion of someone else mentioned in the text.
- Or **even** the true emotion of the speaker (which cannot be definitively known from just a short text snippet).

We acknowledge the importance of this distinction as perceived emotions can differ from actual emotions due to various factors such as cultural context, individual differences in emotional expression, and the limitations of text-based communication (Van Woensel and Nevil 2019, Wakerfield 2021).


# Languages

We include a large number of languages with many predominantly spoken in regions characterised by a relatively limited availability of NLP resources (e.g., Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America):


[Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans), [Algerian Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_Arabic), [Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic), [Brazilian Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Portuguese), [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language), [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language), [Hausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_language), [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi), [Igbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_language),  [Javanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language), [Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language), [isiXhosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_language), [isiZulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_language), [Kinyarwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinyarwanda),  [Marathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language), [Latin American Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language_in_the_Americas), [Moroccan Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Arabic), [Mozambican Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambican_Portuguese), [Nigerian-Pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Pidgin), [Oromo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oromo_language), [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language), [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language), [Setswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tswana_language), [Somali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_language), [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language), [Sundanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundanese_language), [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language), [Tatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatar_language), [Tigrinya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigrinya_language), [Twi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twi),[Xitsonga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsonga_language), [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language), [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language).




# Tracks

Participants can participate in one or more of the following tracks:


### Track A: Multi-label Emotion Detection 
Given a target text snippet, predict the **perceived emotion(s) of the speaker**. Specifically, select whether each of the following emotions apply: **joy**, **sadness**, **fear**, **anger**, **surprise**, or **disgust**. In other words, label the text snippet with:
joy (**1**) or no joy (**0**), sadness (**1**) or no sadness (**0**), anger (**1**) or no anger (**0**), surprise (**1**) or no surprise (**0**), and disgust (**1**) or no disgust (**0**).

**Note that for some languages such as English, the set perceived emotions includes 5 emotions: joy, sadness, fear, anger, or surprise and does not include disgust.** 


A training dataset with gold emotion labels will be provided for this track. 

Below is a sample of the English training data (Track A). A text snippet can have multiple emotions (e.g., the sentence with the ID **sample_05** expresses both joy and surprise), or none (e.g., **sample_04** with all the emotion values equal to 0 is considered neutral).

### Track B: Emotion Intensity
Given a target text  and a target perceived emotion, predict the intensity for each of the classes. 

The set of the perceived emotions includes: **joy**, **sadness**, **fear**, **anger**, **surprise**, or **disgust**.

The set of ordinal intensity classes includes:
**0** for no emotion, **1** for a low degree of emotion, **2** for a moderate degree of emotion, and **3** for a high degree of emotion.

Below is a sample of the English training data (Track B). For each emotion, the value associated with it indicates its degree of intensity. For example, **sample_05** has a value of 3 for joy and a value of 3 for surprise, i.e., **high degrees** of joy and surprise in the text snippet.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daeefcd8-f4b6-46c3-a692-8d8477d1dc11" alt="Sample Training DataB" width="100%">


**Note that for some languages such as English, the set perceived emotions includes 5 emotions: joy, sadness, fear, anger, or surprise and does not include disgust.** 

### Track C: Cross-lingual Emotion Detection 
Given a labeled training set in one of the languages given [above](#languages), predict the perceived emotion labels of a new text instance in a different target language. 

The set of the six perceived emotion classes includes: **joy**, **sadness**, **fear**, **anger**, **surprise**, or **disgust**.

**Note that for some languages such as English, the set perceived emotions includes 5 emotions: joy, sadness, fear, anger, or surprise and does not include disgust.**

# FAQs
<details>
  <summary>Do I have to participate in all languages for a given track?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>No, you can participate in one or more languages.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How will you verify my submitted model?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>To be included in the final team rankings of our shared task, it is mandatory for participants to submit a system description paper describing their approaches and methodologies in detail, therefore ensuring scientific integrity.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>When will you release the gold labels?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>For the dev set, the gold labels will be released when the evaluation phase starts and the gold labels for the different test sets will be released after the competition is over.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use LLMs in the different tracks?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Yes.</li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Can I use additional datasets (e.g, publicly provided ones from other sources)?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Yes. Please do cite them in the system description paper.</li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How was the data collected?</summary>
   <ul>
    <li>
   The data collection process a standard one, you can check previous papers in the area to have an idea (e.g., https://aclanthology.org/S18-1001.pdf). We have data instances (text snippets) annotated by >3 annotators. The annotators       decide whether some emotion is present in a given instance (text snippet). 
   For details about the data sources, annotation guidelines, number of annotators per language, etc., this information will be shared in the dataset paper.
    </li>
   </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How was the data annotated and did you use LLMs to annotate it?</summary>
   <ul>
    <li>
  No. The data instances were annotated by (>=3) native speakers and no LLMs were involved in the process. The annotators labeled the whole sentences not the words and they were expected to have different opinions as (1)this a subjective task and emotions are complex and (2)we were interested in the emotion(s) that they perceived. See the task definition for more details.
    </li>
   </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Will I be included in the final ranking if I do not write a system description paper?</summary>

<details>
  <summary>I have never written a system description paper. How can I write one?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>We will have an online writing tutorial and share resources to help you write a system description paper.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need to pay conference registration fees and/or attend SemEval for my paper to be published?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>It is not required to attend the SemEval workshop for the paper to be published. You do not have to pay any registration fees if you do not attend the workshop. However, if you want to attend the workshop, you need to pay for attendance.</li>
